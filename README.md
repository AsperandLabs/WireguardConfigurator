# Wireguard Configurator
Wireguard is a vpn technology that is catching on fast, the set up is very simple but is time consuming if you are setting up on multiple machines. It can be hard to keep track of all the clients you have once you have a complex network. The only real solution is to keep spread sheets with information of the network you have created. This project aims to solve these issues and add even more convinience features.

## Features
(This application is still in its very begining stages, features and roadmap coming soon)

## Dependencies
This project depends on having the .NET 5 sdk installed for building and the .NET 5 runtime for running. It also expects that you have already installed wireguard on what ever distro you use

## Platform Support
As of right now I am only interested in supporting linux, windows may come in the future but it is far from a priority for me.

## Contributing
Matrix room coming soon to discuss features and how to contribute.
